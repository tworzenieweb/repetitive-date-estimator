# Repetitive Date Estimator

Small project to help estimating events that occurs every month on specific timeframe.

So 2 weeks interval means that it should be estimated for every 15-th and 29-th day of the month
Every 1 week interval means that it should be estimated for every 8-th 15-th 22-th and 29-th of the month.

Of course it is a numeric parameter so it can be even every 5 days.

The goal is to have the even occurs on exactly the same days for each month.
